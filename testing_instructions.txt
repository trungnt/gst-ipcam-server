This is a brief instruction guide to fetch, build and test gst-ipcam-server servers and gst-ipcam-client demo client on Ubuntu 9.04.

=========================================================================
= A. BUILD AND TEST FROM SOURCE                                         =
=========================================================================

A.I. SERVER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.I.1. Fetch Source Code
 - Create a new folder on your hard disk to store source code.
 - Go to that folder and fetch the code with this command:
	$ git clone git://github.com/trungnt/gst-ipcam-server.git
   After finishing this command, a sub-folder named "gst-ipcam-server" will be created with our source code inside.
 - Go to gst-ipcam-server folder:
	$ cd gst-ipcam-server
 - To test a given release XXX, use these commands:
	$ git pull --tags			
	or
	$ git fetch --tags			
	then
	$ git reset --hard XXX
  For example:
	$ git reset --hard 0.1
 - To work with the development version of the servers, use the following command:
   	$ git checkout --track -b server-development origin/server-development
 - Notes: If the development branch was already fetched, no need to fetch it again. Instead, switch to the branch by the commands:
	$ git checkout server-development 	# to switch to an existing server-development branch.
	$ git pull 				# to update to the latest revision.

A.I.2. Build
 - NOTE: before building the server, go to section A.I.3. to check whether all necessary packages are present in your system.
 - Go to the folder "server"
 - For the first time build, run:
   	$ ./autogen.sh
 - Build :
   	$ make

A.I.3. Software Dependencies
A.I.3.a. Standard Gstreamers packages from Ubuntu 9.04 repository:
- Run the following command:
	$ sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad and gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse

If apt-get doesn't found mentioned packages, enable "Community-maintained Open Source software (universe)" and "Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse)" as following:
	+ From the main Ubuntu menu, select "System".
	+ Select "Adminitrastion".
	+ Select "Software Sources"
	+ Check "Community-maintained Open Source software (universe)" and "Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse)".
	+ Click "Close" button.
	+ Then click "Reload" on popup dialog or run "sudo apt-get update" in the terminal.
	+ Once done, you should be able to install necessary packages by re-running the above command.

A.I.3.b. Gstreamer version >= 0.10.24.1, from ppa repository:
- Add following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list (you will need sudo rights):
	deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gstreamer-developers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
	deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/gstreamer-developers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main

- Then:
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-base

A.I.3.c. Build tools, if not installed yet:
	$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake pkg-config libtool build-essential gettext libglib2.0-dev

A.I.4. Run
  We have 9 different servers inside "servers" directory, named as follows:
	- onesrc-h264: server supporting only H264 streams (one source camera).
	- onesrc-jpeg: server supporting only JPEG streams (one source camera).
	- onesrc-mpeg4: server supporting only MPEG4 streams (one source camera).
	- onesrc-jpeg-h264: server supporting JPEG and H264 streams from one source camera.
	- onesrc-jpeg-mpeg4: server supporting JPEG and MPEG4 streams from one source camera.
	- onesrc-h264-mpeg4: server supporting H264 and MPEG4 streams from one source camera.
	- twosrc-jpeg-h264: server supporting JPEG and H264 streams from 2 source cameras.
	- twosrc-jpeg-mpeg4: server supporting JPEG and MPEG4 streams from 2 source cameras.
	- twosrc-h264-mpeg4: server supporting H264 and MPEG4 streams from 2 source cameras.

  The urls for requesting streams are:
	- rtsp://ip:8554/h264 for h264 stream.
	- rtsp://ip:8554/jpg for JPEG stream.
	- rtsp://ip:8554/mpeg4 for MPEG4 stream.
  Where ip is the IP address of the server.

  H264 and MPEG4 support 3 audio formats: AAC, G711 and G726. To enable audio in these stream, launch the servers with audio format as parameter as following:
	$ server_name audio_format
	Where:
	  + server_name is any server support H264 and/or MPEG4 stream(s).
	  + audio_format can be: aac (for AAC), g711 (for G711) and g726 (for G726). This parameter is case-sensitive.
	For example:
	To start MPEG4 server with AAC audio, run:
		$ ./onesrc-mpeg4 aac

A.I.5. Fps Plugin
  Starting from release 0.4, servers come with fps plugin to enable adjusting stream framerate at runtime.

A.I.5.a. Fetch Source Code
  As a note, fps plugin can be installed indepedently from the servers although it is being delivered here together with servers.

A.I.5.b. Build
 - From inside gst-ipcam-server folder, change to gst-fps folder:
	$ cd gst-fps
 - Then:
	$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

A.I.5.c. Usage
 - Fps plugin is a gstreamer plugin therefore can be used in the usual way of using gstreamer plugins.
 - The plugin element's name is fpsbin.
 - fpsbin element has one property: framerate - frame rate value to set to.

A.I.6. Bitrate Plugin
  Starting from release 0.5, servers come with bitrate plugin to enable adjusting bitrate parameter for the video encoder at runtime.

A.I.6.a. Fetch Source Code
  Similar to fps plugin.

A.I.6.b. Build
 - From inside gst-ipcam-server folder, change to gst-bitrate folder:
	$ cd gst-bitrate
 - Then:
	$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

A.I.6.c. Usage
 - Bitrate plugin is a gstreamer plugin therefore can be used in the usual way of using gstreamer plugins.
 - The plugin element's name is bitrate.
 - bitrate element has 2 properties:
	+ encoder-name: name of encoder to control.
	+ bitrate: bitrate value to set to.


A.II. CLIENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.II.1. Fetch Source Code
 - Create a new folder on your hard disk to store source code.
 - Go to that folder and fetch the code with this command:
	$ git clone git://github.com/trungnt/gst-ipcam-server.git
   After finishing this command, a sub-folder named "gst-ipcam-server" will be created with our source code inside.
 - Go to gst-ipcam-server folder:
	$ cd gst-ipcam-server
 - To test a given release XXX, use these commands:
	$ git pull --tags			
	or
	$ git fetch --tags			
	then
	$ git reset --hard XXX
  For example:
	$ git reset --hard 0.1
 - To work with the development version of the client, use the following command:
   	$ git checkout --track -b client-development origin/client-development
 - Notes: If the development branch was already fetched, no need to fetch it again. Instead, switch to the branch by the commands:
	$ git checkout client-development 	# to switch to existing client-development branch.
	$ git pull 				# to update to the latest revision.

A.II.2. Build
 - NOTE: before building the client, go to section A.II.3. to check whether all necessary packages are present in your system.
 - Go to the folder "client".
 - Build the package:
	$ make

A.II.3. Software Requirements

 - Run following command to install required basic gstreamer packages:
	$ sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg

A.II.3.b. Gstreamers version >= 0.10.24.1, from ppa repository:
 - Follow the instructions in section A.I.3.b to add ppa repository to apt-get configuration file.
 - Then:

   	$ ./gst-ipcam-client
 - Usage: The client support the following features:
	+ Connect/Disconnect: connect to/disconnect from a server.
	  Connect: click "Connect" button, input url into popup dialog, then click connect.
	  Disconnect: just click "Disconnect" button.

	+ Pause/Resume: pause/resume the current active stream.

	+ Quit: to quit the client

	+ Adjust parameters: supported runtime adjustable parameters can be changed using drop-down lists for frame rate, frame size, or input field for bitrate. Select or enter the new value then click "Change" button.

A.II.5. Multi-Clients Frontend
  From release 0.3, the client comes with a frontend as a helper to run more than one client.

A.II.5.a. Install requirements packages

        For [client ids], use 'all' to apply to all clients
        For parameters, they can be:
        - fps                                           frame rate. Get available values by using 'values fps'
