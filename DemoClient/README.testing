This's the brief instruction guide to fetch, build and test gst-ipcam-server DemoClient on Ubuntu 9.04

I. FETCH SOURCE CODE
 - Make a new folder to store source code.
 - Go to that folder and fetch the code with this command:
  	$ git clone git://github.com/trungnt/gst-ipcam-server.git
   After finishing this command, a sub-folder named "gst-ipcam-server" will be created with our source code inside.
 - Go to gst-ipcam-server folder:
	$ cd gst-ipcam-server
 - To test the development version, using the following command:
   	$ git checkout --track -b client-development origin/client-development
 - In the case that you've fetch developing code before, you don't need to checkout repository or branch from server.
Otherwise, run following commands:
	$ git checkout client-development 	# to switch to existed client-development branch
	$ git pull 				# to update to the latest version
 
II. BUILD
 - NOTE: before building the client, go to section III to see if your system match dependences and install requirement packages if needed
 - Go to the folder "DemoClient"
 - Build the package:
	$ make

III. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
1.Basic gstreamer packages
 - In order to build and run the demo client, we need following gstreamer packages: libgstreamer0.10-dev, gstreamer0.10-plugins-base, gstreamer0.10-plugins-good, gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad. Run following command to install:
	$sudo apt-get install libgstreamer0.10-dev gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad

2. Gstreamers encoders
 - We need MPEG4 and H.264 encoder from FFMPEG packages. To get these encoders, install the following packages:
	+ gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg version 6.02 (NOTE: must use version 6.02: this's the standard Ubuntu package, ppa package may not work)
	+ libavcodec-unstripped-52

	$sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg libavcodec-unstripped-52
 - After installation, gst-inspect may not found ffenc_mpeg4 and ffenc_libx264. This case often happened when you install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg before with libavcodec package. So, to use them, you must remove old gstreamer plugins registry file by using this command:
	$rm ~/.gstreamer-0.10/registry.*
 
3.Other requirements to build client:
 - Run following command to install other packages to build the demo client:
	$sudo apt-get install autoconf automake pkg-config libtool build-essential gettext libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev

IV. RUN
 - run command
   ./DemoClient
 - Using: the client is simple, investigate and try yourself
