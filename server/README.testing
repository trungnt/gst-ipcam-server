This is the brief instruction guide to fetch, build and test gst-ipcam-server servers on Ubuntu 9.04.

I. FETCH SOURCE CODE
 - Create a new folder to store source code.
 - Go to that folder and fetch the code with this command:
  	$ git clone git://github.com/trungnt/gst-ipcam-server.git
   After finishing this command, a sub-folder named "gst-ipcam-server" will be created with our source code inside.
 - Go to gst-ipcam-server folder:
	$ cd gst-ipcam-server
 - To test the development version, using the following command:
   	$ git checkout --track -b server-development origin/server-development
 - In the case that you've fetch developing code before, you don't need to checkout repository or branch from server.
Otherwise, run following commands:
	$ git checkout server-development 	# to switch to existed server-development branch
	$ git pull 				# to update to the latest version

II. BUILD
 - NOTE: before building the server, go to section III to check whether your system meet necessary packages.
 - Go to the folder "server"
 - For the first time building, run:
   	$ ./autogen.sh
 - Build :
   	$ make

III. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
1. MPEG4 and H.264 encoders
 - We need MPEG4 and H.264 encoder from FFMPEG packages. To get these encoders, install the following packages:
	+ gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg version 6.02 (NOTE: must use version 6.02: this's the standard Ubuntu package, ppa package may not work)
	+ libavcodec-unstripped-52

	$sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg libavcodec-unstripped-52
 - After installing, gst-inspect may not found ffenc_mpeg4 and ffenc_libx264. This case often happens when you install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg before with libavcodec package (which does not come with MPEG4 and H.264 encoders). So, to use them, you must remove old gstreamer plugins registry file by using this command:
	$ rm ~/.gstreamer-0.10/registry.*

2. Gstreamers new version
 - Our server require gstreamer >= 0.10.24.1 but the version comes with ubuntu is 0.10.22. So we will use packages from ppa repository.
 - Add followings line to /etc/apt/sources.list:	 use these code:  
	+ deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gstreamer-developers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main  
	+ deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/gstreamer-developers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main 
 - Then:
	$ sudo apt-get update
 - Then install:
 	$ sudo apt-get install libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev
 
3. Other requirements
 - To build the server, run followings command in order to install needed packages:
	$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake pkg-config libtool build-essential gettext libglib2.0-dev

IV. RUN
   We have 3 server for h264, jpeg and mpeg4 inside servers directory with names : 
    - onesrc-h264 (url: rtsp://ip:8554/h264)
    - onesrc-jpeg (url: rtsp://ip:8554/jpg)
    - onesrc-mpeg4 (url: rtsp://ip:8554/mpeg4)
